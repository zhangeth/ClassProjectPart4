# Class Project: Part 4

This repo is the base codes of the ClassProject of 2023Spring CSCI485.

## Getting Started
You need to copy and paste the code of Part 1, 2 and 3 to this project. 
Your codes need to be put under `src/CSCI485ClassProject/` and its subdirectories. 
Verify correctness by executing the unit test of Part1/Part2/Part3 successfully.

## Project Structure Overview

- `lib`: the dependencies of the project
- `src`: the source codes of the project
  - `CSCI485ClassProject`: root package of the project
    - `models`: package storing some defined representations of models in the database.
    - `test`: package for unit tests
    
## Codes to implement
Under `src/CSCI485ClassProject`, there are 2 classes to finish:
- `RelationalAlgebraOperatorsImpl`: implementation of an interface class `RelationalAlgebraOperators`

Feel free to modify other implementations like `Cursor` if needed.

## Run Tests on macOS/Linux using `make`

If you are developing in `macOS/Linux` environment(recommended), we provide `Makefile` for you to run tests quickly.

To run tests of partX, use command
```shell
make partXTest
```

As you may have different project structures, Makefile may not work in your implementation. In this case, you can change the `sources` variable in Makefile by adding the name of the java files you created to it.
Note that the order of the file should align with the class dependency relationship, i.e. class `A` imports `B`, then `B.java` should be in front of `A.java` in `sources`.
